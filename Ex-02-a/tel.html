	<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
	<p>Telangana, constituent state of south-central India. It is bordered by the states of Maharashtra to the north, Chhattisgarh and Odisha to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the southeast and south, and Karnataka to the west. The area of what is now Telangana constituted the north-central and northeastern portions of Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades, but on June 2, 2014, that territory was calved off to form a separate state. The capital of Telangana is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.</p>
	<h2>Economy of Telengana</h2>
	<p>Telangana’s economy was long dominated by agriculture, notably the production of rice. The state’s rivers, particularly the Godavari and the Krishna, have been tapped to provide irrigation for the dry interior, although many areas still depend on the somewhat unpredictable monsoon rainfall. In addition to rice, other important crops are corn (maize) and cotton.<br>The state’s woodlands annually yield high-quality timber, such as teak and eucalyptus. Non-timber forest products—including sal seeds (from which an edible oil is extracted), tendu leaves (for rolling cigarettes), gum karaya (a type of emulsifier), and bamboo—are also important. The state government initiated a major reforestation program.</p>
	<h2>Cultural life</h2>
	<p>Hyderabad is at the cultural heart of Telangana and is home to numerous museums, religious edifices, and cultural venues. The city is also renowned for its many parks and green spaces, which include one of India’s best-known zoos. <br>In addition, Hyderabad and Warangal are noted for a wealth of historic sites in and around them that chronicle the centuries of Muslim rule in the region. Hyderabad, dubbed Tollywood, is also the centre of a thriving Telugu-language film industry.</p>
