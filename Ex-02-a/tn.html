	<h1> TAMIL NADU </h1>

	<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
	<p>Tamil Nadu, state of India, located in the extreme south of the subcontinent. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the east and south and by the states of Kerala to the west, Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the northwest, and Andhra Pradesh to the north. Enclosed by Tamil Nadu along the north-central coast are the enclaves of Puducherry and Karaikal, both of which are part of Puducherry union territory. The capital is Chennai (Madras), on the coast in the northeastern portion of the state.</p>
	<h2>Economy of Tamil Nadu</h2>
	<p>Agriculture is the mainstay of life for about half the working population of Tamil Nadu. Since very early times, Tamil farmers have skillfully conserved scarce rainwater in small and large irrigation reservoirs, or “tanks.”<br>Tamil Nadu is one of India’s top fish producers, with most of the yield coming from marine operations, although there also are many inland fisheries.<br> In addition, the state has an active forestry sector, with pulpwood, babul (a type of acacia that yields valuable tannin), firewood, bamboo, and teak among the primary products. Rubber, grown largely in plantations, is important as well.</p>
	<h2>Resources and power</h2>
	<p>The major minerals mined in Tamil Nadu are limestone, bauxite, gypsum, lignite (brown coal), magnesite, and iron ore. The opencast lignite mine at Neyveli, in the north-central part of the state, is among the largest in India, and its products are used to fuel a thermal-power plant that provides much of the state’s electricity. The bulk of Tamil Nadu’s energy comes from thermal stations, but hydroelectric plants—especially along the Kaveri River and its tributaries—provide an important secondary source of energy. The state also is a leader in wind-power generation.</p>
